What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

`function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
		
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}`

**O(n)**\
This outputs the fibonacci sequence of a given number.
Accessing properties is O(1), and iterations are based on `num`
