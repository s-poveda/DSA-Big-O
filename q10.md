What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

	function isWhat(n) {
  	if (n < 2 || n % 1 !== 0) {
    	return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
			console.log(n)
      if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
	}

**O(n)** This algorithm checks if a number is divisible by any other number (a.k.a. checks if a number is prime). The checks needed are directly proportional to the size of n.
